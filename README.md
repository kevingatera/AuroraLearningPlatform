# AURORA Learning platform (RHS Hub)

This is an experimental learning platform that I've built during the summer 2017
as a productive pass-time and in collaboration with my younger brother Armand GATERA who is
a high school student and lives in Rwanda. He was acting as my inspiration and UI/UX designer (when he was available ha!).  

**I've not yet added the documentation and the project is still ongoing**
