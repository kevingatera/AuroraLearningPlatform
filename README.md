# Rebranded from KGatewebapp to AURORA Learning platform (RHS Hub)

This is an experimental learning platform that I've been doing this August 2017
as a productive pass-time and in collaboration with my younger brother Armand GATERA who is
a high school student and lives in Rwanda. He is acting as my inspiration and UI/UX designer (when he is available ha!).  

**I've not yet added the documentation and the project is still ongoing**
